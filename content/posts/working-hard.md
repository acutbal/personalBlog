Most of us are productivity gurus on the Internet nowadays. Anyone who works with a computer now has some general ideas of how to achieve productivity and most have those ideas to a fault.  There are a million + one articles floating around claiming to have found the secret for eternal productivity. We watch endless motivational videos and informational videos outlining a 99 step process to plan your whole day, another 98 steps to plan your whole week for optimum productivity. We all strive to be everything and everyone at the same time.

We create audacious goals for ourselves at the beginning of the year and then follow them for like half an hour, and then quit. We then blame ourselves and our lack of information for the slip up and begin our witch hunt for the best "productivity tricks" to achieve our goals. We are always on the lookout for that one perfect system that would achieve what we want on auto-pilot. It's not a fault with ourselves for we humans are wired for growth. Our intention is in the right place but our methods are flawed.
