Introduction
- Why the world is complex
- Why we make it more complex

What is Simplicity
- Definiition of Simplicity
- Difference between simplicity and minimalism

Before we go crazy and start reducing complexity on any system, we need to have a clear cut idea of what a simple system should look like.

Simplify the Complex

The world is inherently complex. Countless moving parts interact in exponential ways to create a a beautiful, functional but complex system. Even though the constituent parts of the system are really simple the consequent complex interactions give the system it's unique characteristics. Take the Universe as an example, it's just couple of subatomic particles all interacting within themselves and the ones around them in ways we don't even know exist, which gives the universe it's unique character.

This type of complexity is inherent in any system and let's call in Natural Complexity. The Natural Complexity of any system is the complexity that is characteristic of the system and cannot be reduced furthur. The Inherent Complexity of the system is the one which the system displays that can be reduced by creating tools. This type of complexity should be cherished. But there is another type of complexity that should be actively reduced to zero and that is Artificial Complexity.

## Artificial Complexity
Humans are the one of the few species on the planet Earth that can create tools to reduce the Inherent Complexity of a system, and the only ones who do it well. It's the capacity to reduce complexity that makes the world go round. But in the race to reduce complexity we introduce Artificial Complexity to the system. It is the complexity that is not inherent to the system but which gets added as the by product of using tools to reduce it. The additional complexity although needed does not add any characteristic to the system in question and should be actively reduced.
