Introduction
- Why the world is complex
- Why we make it more complex

The world by definition is inherently complex. Countless moving parts interact together to create a system so complex we only have the word magic to describe it. This inherent complexity is something that should not be fought with but rather cherished. The natural complexity of any system should be cherished for it is the same complexity that gives the system it's behaviour. The one we should be striving to reduce is artificial complexity.

Humans are the only species that can use tools to such an extent as to reduce the complexity of the world. But in the process we introduce artificial complexity into the system which is often times not needed. They make the system harder to understand and brittle. Once the system becomes hard to understand the people doing modifications on it would automatically shy away from it causing the system to become brittle.

What is Simplicity
- Definiition of Simplicity
- Difference between simplicity and minimalism

Before we go crazy and start reducing complexity on any system, we need to have a clear cut idea of what a simple system should look like.
