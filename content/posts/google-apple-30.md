Put the pitch-fork down and just hear me out. I honestly believe the big tech gaints who have an unchallenged duopoly on the entire mobile computation of the planet still deserve to take 30% cut from a starving Indie developer making Apps in this cut throat competitive, scary world. Yes I do.

For a little context, I'm an Indie App Developer although the only "successful" App that I have built is [Lessphone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.aswinmohan.nophone&hl=en_IN). It's a freemium app that makes around 200-400$ on any given month after Google take their cut.

### Fcuk those Greedy Companies
I have made over 18,000 USD from Lessphone in the past two years and Google has profited around $5400 from it. For merely hosting a 7-8Mb App downloaded around 200,000 times Google made more than $5000, isn't this ripping the consumer and the developer off in every possible way ? I could have hosted my App elsewhere and save $3000 if Google wasn't so anticompetitive and buy that Macbook Pro that I've always wanted. Well not that much.

### Angelic Platforms
What Google and Apple has done to deserve that 30% cut is the creation and maintanence of iOS and Android respectively. Without ginormous investments in money and time from these duopoly these platforms would never have existed and would never have had the market penetration that they have achieved right now, and they deserve the cut that they take.

Consider that we manage to pull off some legislation that brings down the cut, let's try out some of the alternatives.

* The cut is reduced to 10-20%: 
This might not seem like much but is a considerable amount when you take into account the billions it affects. Both these companies are publicily traded and everyone involved has a vested intrest in making the profits roll in. So they are going to cut corners with it. The number of people who manage the App-Stores will be reduced, the already long review process will become even longer. And since the incentive through the App Store has reduced they might take away resources ceasing innovation, in those platforms. In simple terms no more awesome stuff for both developers and users.

* Third Party App Stores: Let's say they enable third party App Stores can sell Apps and have their own payment method. This would lead to more fragmentation and more work for developers. Also even in such a closed an protected App Store we have seen sneaky malaware creep in. Mobile Platforms are much more personal than other computing devices.

* Users can choose their own payment providers: Payments are nasty buisness, anything that interacts with the real world is nasty buisness, and they should be the least concern when you are starting out. That is why everyone goes with an off the shelf payment provider to get a break from all the headaches. But if you are big enough you can have your own payment provider if you can throw a couple of millions at it. That would be a severe blow to the platforms. See the most money comes from a handful of big players, and if you are guarnenteed to lose them when they become big, that would hit it too.

There is no plausible way out. We should have made it an issue before 30% became the norm. If we do something about it now, it's inadvertly going to affect us the developers and ultimately the users.
